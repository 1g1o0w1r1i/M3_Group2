# 1.About Remote Keyless Entry

## 1.1 Description
* Over 70% of the vehicles made today come with a remote keyless entry  system either standard or as an option. 
* RKE systems are also a high volume after-market accessory. Most remote keyless entry systems alarm the vehicle against theft and lock and unlock the doors and trunk. Some include remote start and car finder functions.
* These applications require good transmit-receive range and reliable transmission. Increased receiver sensitivity and high transmit power  directly impact range and reliability.
* Low price is an obvious requirement, as there are millions of these systems being installed.
